# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

To publish your QIHOT HTML page using GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository at: https://github.com/freemanhui/research
2. Click on the "Settings" tab near the top of the page
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages" under "Code and automation"
4. Under "Build and deployment" > "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Under "Branch", select "gh-pages" and "/ (root)" from the dropdown menus
6. Click the "Save" button

After saving, GitHub will start building your GitHub Pages site. This might take a few minutes.

Once published, your site will be available at: https://freemanhui.github.io/research/

The page will automatically redirect to your QIHOT report at: https://freemanhui.github.io/research/QIHOT/index.html
